# container-ui

A zero-dependency, Node.js web UI for managing container images. Supports three backends: a remote container registry (via **skopeo**), **docker**, and **crictl**.

## Features

- List all images with name, tag, digest, and size.
- Per-image actions: **Details**, **Delete**, **Download**, **Pull**, **Verify**.
- Multi-select with bulk **Delete**, **Download**, and **Verify**.
- **Upload** images from a `.tar`, `.tar.gz`/`.tgz`, or `.tar.xz` archive.
- **Pull** an image reference into the active backend.
- Downloads are streamed and compressed as `.tar.xz`.
- **Signature verification**: Ed25519 / X.509 image signatures validated in the browser with real-time status indicators.
- DNS-rebinding and CSRF protection (Host/Origin header validation).
- Debug logging via `DEBUG=1`.

## Requirements

**Always required:**

- **Node.js >= 24**
- `tar`, `xz`, and `gzip` on `PATH`
- **`skopeo`** — used by every backend for all image download/upload (into and out of a portable OCI image layout) and for all registry operations.

**Backend-specific requirements** (one of the following selects the backend):

| Backend | Required binaries | Notes |
|---------|------------------|-------|
| Registry | (skopeo) | `REGISTRY_URL` must be set and reachable. |
| Docker | `docker` | skopeo reads/writes the daemon via the `docker-daemon:` transport. |
| crictl | `crictl` | List/inspect/delete/verify always work. Download/upload additionally require `ctr` (containerd has no skopeo transport, so it is bridged through `ctr`). |

The tool detects prerequisites at startup and exits with a descriptive error if a hard requirement (including skopeo) is missing.

## Quick start

```sh
npm start
```

Open http://127.0.0.1:3000.

## Configuration

All configuration is through environment variables.

### Server

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `PORT` | `3000` | Listening port. |
| `HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | Bind address. |
| `ALLOWED_HOSTS` | `localhost,127.0.0.1,[::1],::1,<HOST>` | Comma-separated list of permitted Host header values. Override when accessing the UI from a non-localhost address. |
| `DEBUG` / `LOG_LEVEL` | — | Set to `1`, `true`, or `debug` to enable verbose debug output on stderr. |

### Signature verification

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `ROOT_CA_PATH` | — | Path to a PEM-encoded root CA certificate used as the trust anchor for image signature verification. Falls back to the embedded CA when unset. |
| `SIGN_LABEL_PREFIX` | `org.mitel.imagesign` | Reverse-DNS prefix of the OCI labels carrying the signature and certificate chain. |

### Remote registry backend

Set `REGISTRY_URL` to a reachable registry to activate the registry backend. It takes precedence over docker/crictl. **`skopeo` must be installed.**

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `REGISTRY_URL` | to enable | Registry base URL, e.g. `https://registry.example.com:5000`. Must be `http://` or `https://`. |
| `REGISTRY_USERNAME` | optional | Username for HTTP Basic authentication. |
| `REGISTRY_PASSWORD` | optional | Password for HTTP Basic authentication. |
| `REGISTRY_CA_PATH` | optional | Path to a PEM CA bundle for a self-signed registry TLS certificate. |
| `REGISTRY_INSECURE` | optional | Set to `1` to skip TLS verification for the registry. |

Credentials are never passed on the skopeo command line. At startup they are written to a `0600` auth file in a private temp directory and exposed to child processes via `REGISTRY_AUTH_FILE`.

When `REGISTRY_URL` is set but the registry is unreachable or `skopeo` is missing, the server logs a warning and falls back to the next available local engine (docker or crictl).

## Backend selection order

1. **Registry** — when `REGISTRY_URL` is set, reachable (`GET /v2/` returns 200), and `skopeo` is installed.
2. **Docker** — when `docker` is found on `PATH`.
3. **crictl** — when `crictl` is found on `PATH`.

The active backend is logged at startup, e.g.:

```
Container engine: registry (https://registry.example.com:5000) via skopeo
Container engine: docker
Container engine: crictl
```

## Feature availability per backend

| Feature | Registry | Docker | crictl |
|---------|----------|--------|--------|
| List images | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Details / inspect | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Delete | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Signature verify | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Pull | ✓ (skopeo copy) | ✓ | ✓ |
| Download | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ with `ctr` |
| Upload | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ with `ctr` |

## Download / upload archive format

**All backends use a single, portable format**, so an image downloaded from one instance of the tool can be uploaded into another regardless of backend (registry → docker → containerd, in any direction).

Archives use the **OCI image layout** format, tar'd and xz-compressed (`.tar.xz`). Each selected image is copied into the layout (with `skopeo`) as `img0`, `img1`, … entries. A `refs.json` sidecar maps each slot back to its original reference so that upload restores the images under their original names.

On download, skopeo reads each image from the active backend:

- Registry → `docker://<host>/<repo>:<tag>`
- Docker → `docker-daemon:<ref>`
- containerd → bridged through `ctr images export` into an intermediate OCI archive that skopeo then reads.

On upload, the same steps run in reverse to load each image back into the active backend. Standard `docker save` / OCI archives produced by other tools can also be uploaded; the tool detects the archive type automatically.

## Image signing

The tooling uses **Ed25519** signatures embedded as OCI config labels. Two shell scripts are provided.

### `image-sign.sh`

Signs an image's layer set with an X.509 key from a PKCS#12 container and writes the signature + certificate chain back as image labels **without adding a filesystem layer** (layer hashes are unchanged).

```sh
./image-sign.sh -s <src-image> -d <dest-image> -p <signer.p12> [-r <label-prefix>] [-n <ctr-ns>]
```

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `-s` | Source image reference (as it appears in docker/ctr/buildah). |
| `-d` | Destination image reference for the signed result. |
| `-p` | PKCS#12 file containing the private key + leaf certificate + intermediate CA. |
| `-r` | Label prefix (default: `org.mitel.imagesign`). |
| `-n` | containerd namespace (default: `k8s.io`). |

The PKCS#12 passphrase is read from `$P12_PASSWORD` or prompted interactively.

**Required tools:** `skopeo`, `umoci`, `openssl`, `jq`, `base64`, `sha256sum`.

**Source store auto-detection:** docker → ctr → buildah (first that contains the image).

The signing algorithm:

1. Export the image to an OCI layout.
2. Compute `LAYER_HASH = SHA-256(diff_id_1\ndiff_id_2\n...)` as a 64-char hex string.
3. Sign `LAYER_HASH` with `openssl pkeyutl -sign -rawin`.
4. Attach `<prefix>.signature`, `<prefix>.certchain`, and `<prefix>.alg=ed25519` labels via `umoci config --no-history` (no new layer added, diff_ids unchanged).
5. Import the signed image back into the same store.

### `image-verify.sh`

Verifies a signed image's certificate chain and signature.

```sh
./image-verify.sh -i <image> [-c <root-ca.pem>] [-r <label-prefix>] [-n <ctr-ns>]
```

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `-i` | Image reference to verify. |
| `-c` | Root CA PEM file. Falls back to the embedded CA when omitted. |
| `-r` | Label prefix (default: `org.mitel.imagesign`). |
| `-n` | containerd namespace (default: `k8s.io`). |

Exits `0` when both certificate chain and signature checks pass, `1` otherwise.

**Required tools:** `openssl`, `jq`, `base64`, `sha256sum`.

### In-browser verification

The UI's **Verify** button runs the same algorithm as `image-verify.sh` entirely on the server (Node.js `node:crypto`), using the configured root CA or the embedded fallback. Each image gets a colour-coded status dot:

- **Green** — signature valid, chain chains to the trusted CA.
- **Red** — signature invalid or certificate chain broken.
- **Grey** — no signature labels found on the image.

## Tests

```sh
npm test
```

Uses Node.js's built-in test runner (`node:test`). No external test dependencies.

## Security notes

- The server has **no authentication**. Bind to a trusted/local address. Use `ALLOWED_HOSTS` when exposing beyond localhost and place an authenticating reverse proxy in front.
- Registry credentials are never passed on the command line (visible via `ps`). They are written to a `0600` temp file and consumed by skopeo via `REGISTRY_AUTH_FILE`.
- All user-supplied image references are validated before being passed to CLI tools: leading `-` and control characters are rejected to prevent argument injection.
- The registry HTTP client caps redirect following at 5 hops and enforces a 15-second request timeout.
